## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Initialize the plugin

```dart
await YtFlutterMusicapi().initialize(
  proxy: null,
  country: 'US',
);
```

### 2. Perform a direct search

```dart
final result = await YtFlutterMusicapi().searchMusic(
  query: 'Alan Walker Faded',
  limit: 5,
  audioQuality: 'VERY_HIGH',
  thumbQuality: 'VERY_HIGH',
);

print(result['title']); // Outputs: Faded
```

### 3. Stream results in real-time

```dart
await for (final song in YtFlutterMusicapi().streamSearchResults(
  query: 'Alan Walker Faded',
  limit: 5,
  audioQuality: 'VERY_HIGH',
  thumbQuality: 'VERY_HIGH',
)) {
  print('🎧 ${song['title']} by ${song['artists']}');
}
```

> ⚡ Fast feedback: Items arrive as they're fetched — perfect for CLI-style UIs and progressive lists.
